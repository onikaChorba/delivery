# 🛍️ Welcome to my React Shopping Website Delivery! 

This shopping website is designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience. It allows you to explore different stores, browse their products, add items to your cart, modify quantities, and calculate the total cost of your purchases. The website leverages React for building interactive user interfaces, Redux for state management, and SCSS for flexible styling.

## 🏬 Store Selection
On the homepage, you will find a selection of various stores. By clicking on a store, you can access its collection of products.

## 🛒 Product Display
Once you select a store, the website dynamically retrieves and displays the available products. Each product card showcases essential details such as the name, price, and image of the product.

## 🛍️ Add to Cart
To add a product to your cart, simply click the "Add to Cart" button on the product card. The selected item will be added to your shopping cart.

## 🔄 Quantity Modification
In the shopping cart, you have the flexibility to modify the quantity of each product. Using the "+" and "-" buttons, you can increase or decrease the quantity of an item. The total cost of the product is automatically updated based on these changes.

## 💰 Total Cost Calculation
The website calculates the total cost of all the products in your cart. As you modify the quantities, the total cost is dynamically recalculated, providing you with an up-to-date view of your purchases.

## 🔁 Redux Integration
To manage the state of the application, Redux is employed. Redux actions are used to fetch product data from an API and store it in the Redux store. The cart items and their quantities are also stored in Redux, enabling seamless management and updates.

## 💅 SCSS Styling
The website's visual appearance is enhanced using SCSS. SCSS provides a powerful and flexible styling approach, allowing for easy customization and maintenance of the website's design.
